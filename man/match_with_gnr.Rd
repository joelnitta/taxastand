\usage{
match_with_gnr(names, data_source_ids = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{Character vector of names to resolve}

\item{data_source_ids}{Numeric vector of data source IDs to use for
search. Default = 1, the Catalog of Life. For other data sources, see
\code{\link[taxize]{gnr_datasources}}}
}

\description{
Attempts to match hybrid names usually don't work, so any names
that appear to by hybrids (e.g., with " x " in the name) are excluded
}
\details{
It is not recommended to use more than one data source at a time, and
default search values are set with this expectation.

Requires \href{https://gitlab.com/gogna/gnparser}{gnparser} to be installed
and on the user's PATH.
