\usage{
resolve_names_full(names_to_resolve, taxonomic_standard,
  max_dist = c(scientific_name = 0, taxon = 0, species = 0),
  resolve_by_taxon = TRUE, resolve_by_species = TRUE,
  gnparser_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{names_to_resolve}{Character vector; taxonomic names to resolve.}

\item{taxonomic_standard}{Dataframe of standard names to match to.}

\item{max_dist}{Named integer vector; maximum distance to use during
fuzzy matching by taxonomic rank.
Names of \code{max_dis} must include 'scientific_name', 'taxon', and 'taxon'.}

\item{resolve_by_taxon}{Logical; should names be resolved using taxon?}

\item{resolve_by_species}{Logical; should names be resolved using species name?}

\item{gnparser_path}{String; path to gnparser executable.
Either this must be provided, or gnparser must be on $PATH.}

\description{
The input (\code{names_to_resolve}) may include species names formatted
with or without author or infraspecific epithet. Names will be matched
recursively in order of scientific name (full name with author), taxon
name (name including infraspecific epithet but no author), then species
(genus plus specific epithet only).
}
\details{
Requires gnparser (https://gitlab.com/gogna/gnparser/)
to be installed.
